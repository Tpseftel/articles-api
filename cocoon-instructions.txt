We want to build the back end system for a mobile app that displays a list of news articles. Every news article should have the following:

Title, summary, content, published status, published date
It will belong to a news category
It will have an author



You need to develop the following:

 - An admin panel that can be used to store & update the above information
 - Create a REST API point that a mobile app can use to retrieve the news article list
 - You can use any programming language / framework you feel most comfortable with.

What you need to deliver:
 - The source code of your app
 - Any necessary instructions on how we can run/test your app (Assume that we have no experience/knowledge on how to do this)
 - The source code should be well commented and written in a structured way


Deadline

!!!! The deadline to finish the task and send the source code is Monday 15/6 at 09:00.!!!!!

If you have any questions don't hesitate to get in touch.

Good luck!
